# Snap Machine Learning (Snap ML) Examples

This directory contains examples for Snap ML.
Snap ML is included in the IBM Watson Machine Learning
Community Edition (WML CE) in the `pai4sk` conda package.

## NYC Taxi Tip prediction notebook using Snap ML Ridge and Logistic Regression
The [nyc_taxi_tip_predict_notebook.ipynb](nyc_taxi_tip_predict_notebook.ipynb) notebook
demonstrates training a Ridge Regression and Logistic Regression model using Snap ML.
The models trained using Snap ML are compared for accuracy and performance against scikit-learn
and RAPIDS cuML.

## Allstate Claim prediction challenge using Snap ML Logistic Regression
The [insurance-claims.ipynb](insurance-claims.ipynb) notebook
demonstrates training a Logistic Regression model using Snap ML.
The models trained using Snap ML are compared for accuracy and performance against scikit-learn.

pyglet provides an object-oriented programming interface for developing games
and other visually-rich applications for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

Requirements
------------

pyglet runs under Python 2.7, and 3.4+. The entire codebase is fully 2/3 dual
compatible, making use of the future module for backwards compatibility with
legacy Python. Being written in pure Python, it also works on other Python
interpreters such as PyPy. pyglet works on the following operating systems:

* Windows XP or later
* Mac OS X 10.3 or later
* Linux, with the following libraries (most recent distributions will have
  these in a default installation):
    * OpenGL and GLX
    * GDK 2.0+ or PIL (required for loading images other than PNG and BMP)
    * Pulseaudio or OpenAL (required for playing audio)
    
Installation
------------

If you're reading this README from a source distribution, you can install
pyglet with:

    python setup.py install

There are no compilation steps during the installation; if you prefer,
you can simply add this directory to your PYTHONPATH and use pyglet without
installing it. You can also copy pyglet directly into your project folder.

The documentation is available online at pyglet.org, but if you want to
build the documentation yourself, please check the README file in the doc
directory.

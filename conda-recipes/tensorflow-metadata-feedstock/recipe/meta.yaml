  summary: "Utilities for passing TensorFlow-related metadata between tools"
  description: |
      TensorFlow Metadata provides standard representations for metadata
      that are useful when training machine learning models with TensorFlow.
      The metadata serialization formats include- 
          - A schema describing tabular data (e.g., tf.Examples).
          - A collection of summary statistics over such datasets.
          - A problem statement quantifying the objectives of a model.
      The metadata may be produced by hand or automatically during input data analysis,
      and may be consumed for data validation, exploration, and transformation.

The AI Fairness 360 toolkit is an extensible open-source library containg techniques developed by the
research community to help detect and mitigate bias in machine learning models throughout the AI application lifecycle.
The AI Fairness 360 Python package includes
1) a comprehensive set of metrics for datasets and models to test for biases,
2) explanations for these metrics, and
3) algorithms to mitigate bias in datasets and models.
It is designed to translate algorithmic research from the lab into the actual practice of domains as wide-ranging
as finance, human capital management, healthcare, and education. We invite you to use it and improve it.

The [AI Fairness 360 interactive experience](http://aif360.mybluemix.net/data)
provides a gentle introduction to the concepts and capabilities. The [tutorials
and other notebooks](./examples) offer a deeper, data scientist-oriented
introduction. The complete API is also available.

Being a comprehensive set of capabilities, it may be confusing to figure out
which metrics and algorithms are most appropriate for a given use case. To
help, we have created some [guidance
material](http://aif360.mybluemix.net/resources#guidance) that can be
consulted.

We have developed the package with extensibility in mind. This library is still
in development. We encourage the contribution of your metrics, explainers, and
debiasing algorithms.

## Setup

Supported Configurations:

| OS      | Python version |
| ------- | -------------- |
| macOS   | 3.5, 3.6, 3.7  |
| Ubuntu  | 3.5, 3.6, 3.7  |
| Windows | 3.5, 3.6, 3.7  |

NOTE: Python 2.7 support has been **deprecated** in this version. This message
will be removed in the next release.

See the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section if you have issues.

### (Optional) Create a virtual environment

AIF360 requires specific versions of many Python packages which may conflict
with other projects on your system. A virtual environment manager is strongly
recommended to ensure dependencies may be installed safely. If you have trouble
installing AIF360, try this first.

#### Conda

Conda is recommended for all configurations though Virtualenv is generally
interchangeable for our purposes ([CVXPY](#cvxpy) may require conda in some
cases). Miniconda is sufficient (see [the difference between Anaconda and
Miniconda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/download.html#anaconda-or-miniconda)
if you are curious) and can be installed from
[here](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) if you do not already have it.

Then, to create a new Python 3.5 environment, run:

```bash
conda create --name aif360 python=3.5
conda activate aif360
```

The shell should now look like `(aif360) $`. To deactivate the environment, run:

```bash
(aif360)$ conda deactivate
```

The prompt will return to `$ `.

Note: Older versions of conda may use `source activate aif360` and `source
deactivate` (`activate aif360` and `deactivate` on Windows).

### Install with minimal dependencies

To install the latest stable version from PyPI, run:

```bash
pip install aif360
```

Some algorithms require additional dependencies not included in the minimal
installation. To use these, we recommend a full installation.

### Full installation

Clone the latest version of this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/AIF360
```

If you'd like to run the examples, download the datasets now and place them in
their respective folders as described in
[aif360/data/README.md](aif360/data/README.md).

Then, navigate to the root directory of the project and run:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

#### Run the Examples

To run the example notebooks, complete the full installation steps above. Then,
install the additional requirements as follows:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, follow the [Getting Started](https://pytorch.org) instructions from
PyTorch to download and install the latest version for your machine. With conda,
this is simple:

```bash
# LINUX/WINDOWS
conda install pytorch-cpu torchvision-cpu -c pytorch
# MACOS
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
```

For CUDA support or alternative installation, see the instructions.

Finally, if you did not already, download the datasets as described in
[aif360/data/README.md](aif360/data/README.md).

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any errors during the installation process, look for your
issue here and try the solutions.

#### TensorFlow

In some cases, the URL is required for installation:

```bat
# WINDOWS
pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-1.14.0-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl

# MACOS
pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-1.14.0-py3-none-any.whl

# LINUX
pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-1.14.0-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl
```

TensorFlow is only required for use with the
`aif360.algorithms.inprocessing.AdversarialDebiasing` class.

#### CVXPY

On MacOS, you may first have to install the Xcode Command Line Tools if you
never have previously:

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

And then, re-run:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On Windows, you may need to download the appropriate [Visual Studio C++
compiler for Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers#Microsoft_Visual_C.2B-.2B-_14.0_standalone:_Build_Tools_for_Visual_Studio_2017_.28x86.2C_x64.2C_ARM.2C_ARM64.29). Then,
re-run:

```bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

See the [CVXPY Installation
Instructions](https://www.cvxpy.org/install/index.html#windows)
for an alternate installation procedure using conda.

CVXPY is only required for use with the
`aif360.algorithms.preprocessing.OptimPreproc` class.

## Using AIF360

The `examples` directory contains a diverse collection of jupyter notebooks
that use AI Fairness 360 in various ways. Both tutorials and demos illustrate
working code using AIF360. Tutorials provide additional discussion that walks
the user through the various steps of the notebook. See the details about
[tutorials and demos here](examples/README.md)
